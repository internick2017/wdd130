              <p>
                Whitewater rafting is a thrilling and challenging sport that takes
                you through the rapids of a river. Rapids are formed by the river's
                current flowing over rocks and other obstacles. The water is
                turbulent and fast-moving, creating a fun and exciting ride for
                rafters. Whitewater rafting is a popular outdoor activity that is
                enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Whether you are a
                beginner or an experienced rafter, there is a whitewater rafting
                trip that is perfect for you.
